Project Showcase: Fixed Deposit (FD) Calculator üí∞
I'm excited to share my latest front-end project: an interactive Fixed Deposit (FD) Calculator built for Indian users, supporting inputs in Indian Rupees (‚Çπ). This tool simplifies the complex process of calculating maturity amounts and interest earned on FDs, helping users make informed investment decisions quickly and accurately.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Highlights
Frontend Framework: React for building a fast, component-based, and state-driven user interface.

UI/Styling: Material UI (MUI) was leveraged extensively to create a sleek, professional, and mobile-responsive design that aligns with modern web standards and Google's Material Design principles. The pre-built, customizable components significantly accelerated development and ensured a polished user experience, as evidenced in the attached screenshot.

Logic: Custom JavaScript logic handles the financial calculations, accurately computing the FD maturity amount based on the principal, tenure, and interest rate, using the appropriate compound interest formula.

‚ú® Key Features
Rupee-Specific Input: Designed for Indian users with clear input fields for amounts in ‚Çπ (Rupees).

Intuitive Interface: Utilizes Material UI components like text fields, sliders, and buttons to offer a clean, intuitive, and accessible user experience.

Instant Calculation: Provides immediate results for the total maturity amount and the interest earned, eliminating the need for manual calculations.

Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices, thanks to Material UI's responsive grid system.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to solidify my skills in state management within React and implement a complex UI using a professional component library like Material UI.
